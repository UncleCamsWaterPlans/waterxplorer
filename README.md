# Explore the QLD Governments Water Data

Graphical data explorer for Queenslands hydrographic water monitoring network. With widespread flooding around Cairns in December 2023 (Cyclone Jasper: Cat 2) this has been a handy tool to examine the time series river heights and discharges. It also allows the user to assess exceedance probability; *likelyhood of a given level to be matched or exceeded based on the data visualised*. 

Data is made available from the [WMIP](https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/) care of The Queensland Government 2023 &copy;  

Simple app for learning Streamlit. But at the same time useful for quickly viewing water data using plotly.
